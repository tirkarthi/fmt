Building on Windows requires a Unix-like environment, notably a Unix-like shell. There are several such environments available of which Cygwin and MinGW/MSYS are currently supported for the OpenJDK build. One of the differences of these systems from standard Windows tools is the way they handle Windows path names, particularly path names which contain spaces, backslashes as path separators and possibly drive letters. Depending on the use case and the specifics of each environment these path problems can be solved by a combination of quoting whole paths, translating backslashes to forward slashes, escaping backslashes with additional backslashes and translating the path names to their "8.3" version.
